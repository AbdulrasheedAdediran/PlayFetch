# PlayFetch
### This repository contains my solution to [Challenge 2](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/challenge-2-play-fetch-with-random-values-and-arrays?uv=2020.3&courseId=5cf96c41edbc2a2ca6e8810f&projectId=5cdcc312edbc2a24a41671e6) in the [Unity Junior Programmer Pathway](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/junior-programmer).


### Challenge:
- A random ball (of 3) should be generated at a random x position and time (between a specified range) above the screen.
- When the user presses spacebar, a dog should be spawned to go catch the ball.
- If the dog collides with the ball, the ball should be destroyed.
- If the ball hits the ground, a “Game Over” message should be displayed.
- The dogs and balls should be removed from the scene when they leave the screen.
- User should only be able to spawn the dog once between preset intervals.
